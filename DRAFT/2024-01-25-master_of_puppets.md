# Master of Puppets üé≠üìä

Hello, PowerPoint enthusiasts! At The Prompt Pub today, we're talking about a game-changer in the world of presentations: using puppets! And not just any puppets, but those crafted with the marvels of AI. This will help your presentation to be more enanching... Last but not the list, you can calibrate the right amout of funnines and seriousness by keeping peole engaged!

Let's start from the top: I'll start with a use case of a solar system presentation. I asked copilot pro to produce the PPT, the I added the puppets to make it better. Let's start by pointing out why I, you, whoever should do it.

### Why Puppets in a PowerPoint Presentation?

- **Attention-Grabbing:** Puppets turn heads and keep eyes glued to the screen.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** They add a layer of interaction and storytelling.
- **Memorable Presentations:** Puppets leave a lasting impression, ensuring your message sticks.

### A Stellar Use Case: The Solar System Presentation

- **Educational and Fun:** How puppets can transform a standard solar system presentation into an engaging educational experience.
- **Narrative Techniques:** Using puppet characters to guide the audience on a cosmic journey.

### And Then Come Astronaut Cats...

- **Why Astronaut Cats?:** They're quirky, fun, and perfect for a unique spin on the solar system.
- **Creating with DALL-E 3:** A step-by-step guide on using DALL-E 3 to bring astronaut cat puppets to life.
- **Integrating into PowerPoint:** Tips on embedding these AI-generated feline cosmonauts into your slides.

## A ppt pre ad post

 Here you can find the presentation created by Copilot Pro with my personal licence of Microsoft365.
 As you can see, the presentation is quite poor,  even because I did not added or modified it. It is just the first draft.

The general outline is:

- A title
- a brief summary
- The Sun
- The Planets
- Moons
- Asteroid and Comets

And of course it will be necessary, if this presentation shall be shown for a lesson, to add a lot of information, but let's keep it to give it a go with the puppet mastery!

Let's start with the __Table of content__ slide. Here we can add a simple astrocat... ehm.. astronaut cat, with a blackboard.

Here the prompt i used:

`A cartoon astronaut cat wearing a spacesuit and holding a signboard, designed to display a table of contents for a presentation.`

And this is the result:

<figure align="center">

    <figcaption  align="center">This is the first puppet i generated for the table of conent</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

Now... you can either choose to use it as it is, or you can use paint to remove the background (you can check this [previous tutorial](https://malgocoder54.github.io//2023/12/22/xmas-avatar.html) if you want), or do it directly in PowerPoint, if it's quite uniform in color, with the option "set transparent colour". (for this case i used Paint to leverage AI power in detecting the main subject)

Those are the slides before and after:

<p align="center">
<figure align="center">
    <img src="https://malgocoder54.github.io/assets/masterofpuppets/before.png"/>
    <figcaption  align="center">Before Pupper</figcaption>

    <figcaption  align="center">After the Puppet (with the help of "Designer" function to fit the layout)</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

I then imagined and crafted other astrocats, one for each slides! In the table below you can find all the prompts and the images!

Finally, here the [new version]() of the presentation!


## Conclusion

And there you have it, fellow explorers of the cosmos and creativity! Using DALL-E 3, we've successfully embarked on a journey to create astronaut cat characters, each adding a dash of whimsy and wonder to our solar system presentation. These charming feline cosmonauts aren't just a visual treat; they represent the intersection of technology, art, and education, showing us that learning can be as engaging as it is informative.

Remember, the universe of presentation design is as boundless as space itself. So, why not infuse your next PowerPoint with a bit of this creative stardust? Whether it's through astronaut cats, interstellar landscapes, or any other imaginative concept you conjure up, the key is to have fun and let your creativity soar.

We can't wait to see the fantastic presentations you'll create! Don't forget to share your spacefaring cat adventures with us here at The Prompt Pub. After all, every great journey is better with companions.

Until our next creative endeavor, keep exploring, keep imagining, and keep presenting! üåüüöÄüê±üìäüé®
