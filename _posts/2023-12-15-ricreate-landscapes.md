# The Dream Team(s) background

Hello everyone! Today, I'd like to take you on a personal journey that led me to experiment with Bing Chat, aiming to create a custom background for my Teams calls. Have you ever stumbled upon a breathtaking landscape or a charming corner in a bar or bookstore and thought, 'How perfect this would be as my background?' Maybe you didn't have a camera on hand, or you're not exactly a professional photographer. Well, with the power of GenAI, you don't need to be! You can capture and transform these inspiring scenes into unique backgrounds for your own use. No professional equipment or skills needed!

In this tutorial I'll use the microsoft copilot pubblicly avaliable: [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)

## Chapter 1: A Cozy Bar

I was wandering around the city with my wife, my daughter, and my dog when we stumbled upon a bar with a particularly cozy atmosphere. The soft lighting, vintage furniture, bookshelves, and Christmas lights all contributed to a relaxed vibe - everything about this place was inspiring. I thought, 'This would be the perfect background for my Teams calls, if only I could paint or take professional photos.' So, considering GenAI as an extension of myself, I took a picture while sitting and waiting for my hot cappuccino and soft chocolate croissant, and started prompting :)

## Chapter 2: The first prompt

I began by uploading the picture to Bing Chat and asked it what kind of prompt it would use to recreate the same picture. I know, it's not exactly a product of my own imagination, but I must admit, I lack an artistic streak!

`What prompt would you pass to Dall.e3 to generate the very same image?`

And that was the answer:

`A cozy bookstore or library with wooden shelves filled with a diverse collection of books and wine bottles. The ceiling is adorned with bare tree branches intertwined with twinkling fairy lights, and a single white pendant light hangs from the ceiling. Two people are browsing or reading in the warm yellow light.`

When I asked:

`Can you create that?`

I got these pictures:

    <figcaption  align="center">The first picture that represent the bar</figcaption>

</p>

They were amazing, but I did not want any person in it, just the place, so i kindly asked:

`Can you do it with no people in it?`

And there it is!

## Chapter 3: Playing with Bing Chat

Okay, the base image is truly amazing! It captures the cozy atmosphere of the bar beautifully. 

But, as always, I want to add a touch of personal flair! I have a particular fondness for large windows with views of a forest outside, so that's the element I decided to incorporate next. Moreover, the picure it is see by an angle that would it make it not very suitable for a teams background, and I'd love to have a front camera.

`can you do it, with the same style, but like it was a cozy wood cabin with a big window? outside the window I'd love to see a wood, in late fall, with the snow that begin to fall. Inside a desk and a library`

<p align="center">

    <figcaption  align="center">That is a standard cabin though.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

And this one is very nice as well!

    <img src="https://malgocoder54.github.io/assets/img_create-avatar001/pt3_3.jpg"/>
    <figcaption  align="center">Amazing wooden cabin, but still not quite as I want them :) </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

Now, we miss only the faily light, so i went back to the first prompt and I told Bing:

`can you add also these details? shelves filled with a diverse collection of books and wine bottles. The ceiling is adorned with bare tree branches intertwined with twinkling fairy lights, and a single white pendant light hangs from the ceiling.`

Here we are!!

    <figcaption  align="center">This is the standard form to fill to get the first prompt on aka.ms/DesignMe</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

## Chapter 4: My New Teams Background

Last bit... I'd love to make the cozy wood cabin even more mine... So a desk and a laptop are mandatory :) Here the last prompt:

`now add a surface laptop` 

And that were the results:

<p align="center">
<figure align="center">
    <img src="https://malgocoder54.github.io/assets/img_create-avatar001/pt5.jpg"/>
    <figcaption  align="center">One of my favourite last images</figcaption>
