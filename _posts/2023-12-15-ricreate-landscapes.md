# The Dream Team(s) background

Hello everyone! Today, I'd like to take you on a personal journey that led me to experiment with Bing Chat, aiming to create a custom background for my Teams calls. Have you ever stumbled upon a breathtaking landscape or a charming corner in a bar or bookstore and thought, 'How perfect this would be as my background?' Maybe you didn't have a camera on hand, or you're not exactly a professional photographer. Well, with the power of GenAI, you don't need to be! You can capture and transform these inspiring scenes into unique backgrounds for your own use. No professional equipment or skills needed!

In this tutorial I'll use the microsoft copilot pubblicly avaliable: [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)

## Chapter 1: A Cozy Bar

I was wandering around the city with my wife, my daughter, and my dog when we stumbled upon a bar with a particularly cozy atmosphere. The soft lighting, vintage furniture, bookshelves, and Christmas lights all contributed to a relaxed vibe - everything about this place was inspiring. I thought, 'This would be the perfect background for my Teams calls, if only I could paint or take professional photos.' So, considering GenAI as an extension of myself, I took a picture while sitting and waiting for my hot cappuccino and soft chocolate croissant, and started prompting :)

## Chapter 2: The first prompt

I began by uploading the picture to Bing Chat and asked it what kind of prompt it would use to recreate the same picture. I know, it's not exactly a product of my own imagination, but I must admit, I lack an artistic streak!

`What prompt would you pass to Dall.e3 to generate the very same image?`

And that was the answer:

`bookstore or library with a cozy atmosphere and fairy lights. shelf in the back. realistic photo.`

When I asked:

`create the image of a bookstore or library with a cozy atmosphere and fairy lights. shelf in the back. realistic photo.`

I got these pictures:

## Chapter 3: Playing with Bing Chat

Okay, the base image is truly amazing! It captures the cozy atmosphere of the bar beautifully. 

But, as always, I want to add a touch of personal flair! I have a particular fondness for large windows with views of a forest outside, so that's the element I decided to incorporate next. Moreover, the oicure it is see by an angle that would it make it not very suitable for a teams background, and I'd love to have a front camera.

`bookstore or library with a cozy atmosphere and fairy lights. shelf in the back and seen frontaly. realistic photo.`

Nice! It's getting in the right place! Let's even personalise it more: I'd love cabin woods with a view on trees in late autumn when it begins to snow. So that's what i asked!

`bookstore or library like wood cabin with a cozy atmosphere and fairy lights. shelf in the back and seen frontaly. on the left a big window. outside the window an autumn wood with little snow. realistic photo.`

Couple of picture hit me:

## Chapter 4: My New Teams Background

Last bit... I'd love to make the cozy wood cabin even more mine... So a desk and a laptop are mandatory :) Here the last prompt:

bookstore or library like wood cabin with a cozy atmosphere and fairy lights. shelf in the back and seen frontaly. on the left a big window. outside the window an autumn wood with little snow. at the center a desk with an open surface pc laptop. realistic photo.

And that was the result:
