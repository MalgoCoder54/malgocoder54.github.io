Join us at The Prompt Pub as we

## Prepping Your Avatar
Before we dive into the tinsel and lights, let's start with the basics. If you've followed my [previous guide](https://malgocoder54.github.io/2023/12/10/create-avatar001.html), you've got a smashing avatar ready. But if it's still lounging against a drab background, fear not! Microsoft Paint's 'Remove Background' feature will help isolate your digital mini-me. Simply upload your avatar and let Paint work its magic, leaving you with a clean slate ready for a holiday revamp.

Now you are ready to add the xmas spirit to it!

## Crafting a Festive Scene with Paint Co-Designer

Now, let's get to the fun part! Layers are like the floors of a holiday department store, each with its own set of delights. First, we'll lay down the groundwork with a festive background. In Paint clik on the Layer button and then on the "+" button to add a layer.

    <figcaption  align="center"><em>Load your avatar and click on "Remove Backround" button to have just the avatar with no background.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

Now, the button next to the "Layers" one is where the XMas magic happens! If you click on the new layer, than on the "Co-creator" button, a ribbon where you can prompt pops out.

    <figcaption  align="center"><em>Open the cocreator ribbon</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

Now It's time to prompt! To create a background I used this one:

`A big squared window, only the loom. the glass may be present but they must be transparent. Make it like it is in a mountain chalet, in light brown wood. Outside the window a winter forest. Make it in cartoon style`


And I choose the one I loved the most. By having it in the second layer, the Avatar will appear to be in front of the window!

    <figcaption align="center"><em>Add the background</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>


Now you can add all the elements you like! Add each element as a separate layer, giving you the freedom to adjust and reposition as you see fit. Remember, co-designer is your creative companion, suggesting and generating elements that bring your holiday vision to life.
If you want a different flavour of the background, or the other elements, you can choos a specific style in the cocreator ribbon!

    <figcaption  align="center"><em>Select a style </em></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

For the final edit, I asked the cocreator to add a santa hat:

`a XMas hat in cartoon style. Only the hat with white background like a PNG.`

## Perfecting Your Holiday Avatar

With your avatar now merrily adorned, it's time to ensure everything looks top-notch. Play around with each layer, adjusting positions and sizes to make sure your avatar isn't hidden behind a giant Santa hat or obscured by an oversized ornament. I created a layer with a Santa hat, indeed, and placed it in front of my avatar (of course I took care of the white background), fitting onto my head. Remeber to resize the avatar to have it proportional to the whole picture!
Feel free to tweak the opacity of your layers for that perfect ghostly snow effect or a subtle glow from holiday lights. The goal is a harmonious holiday avatar that's uniquely yours.

**That's what I came up with at the end!**
