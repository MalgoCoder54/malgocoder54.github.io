# How to prompt your avatar

prompting an avatar is not like making one from zero,
nor you can decide to edid single pieces! you have to describe very well
what kind of avatar you want and it will appear in the chat!

To complete this exercise I will use Microsoft Copilot and the Dall-e3 engine accessible
via chat.
